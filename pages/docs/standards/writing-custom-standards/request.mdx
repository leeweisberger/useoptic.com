# Request

A `RequestRule` allows you to write rules about the request bodies in your OpenAPI specification.

```javascript
new RequestRule({
  name: "prevent request removal",
  rule: (requestAssertions) => {
    requestAssertions.body.removed("not remove request", () => {
      throw new RuleError({
        message: "cannot remove an request",
      });
    });
  },
});
```

`new RequestRule(options)`

The following table describes the options object.

| property | description                                                                                                                                                                                               | required | type                                                                       |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name     | the name of the rule                                                                                                                                                                                      | yes      | `string`                                                                   |
| matches  | A function used to determine when this Rule should be applied. Return true to indicate this Rule should run.                                                                                              | no       | `(request: RequestBody, ruleContext: RuleContext) => boolean`              |
| docsLink | A link to the documentation for this ruleset. This will be used to show the user on a rule error. If there is a more specific docsLink (e.g. on a nested Rule), the more specific docsLink will be shown) | no       | `string`                                                                   |
| rule     | A function to define assertions for a specification.                                                                                                                                                      | yes      | `(requestAssertions: RequestAssertions, ruleContext: RuleContext) => void` |

## matches

`matches` is invoked with a `RequestBody` and `RuleContext` objects. The `RequestBody`corresponds to the `RequestBody` that this rule would run on. The `RuleContext` object contains details about the location. Return a boolean to indicate whether this rule should be run on the `RequestBody` provided.

Example:

```javascript
new RequestRule({
  ...,
  // only matches requests with content type 'application/json' in post operations
  matches: (request, ruleContext) => ruleContext.operation.method === 'post' && request.contentType === 'application/json',
  ...
});
```

## requestAssertions.body

```javascript
new RequestRule({
  ...,
  rule: (requestAssertions) => {
    // lifecycle rules that are available are added, changed, addedOrChanged, requirement and removed
    requestAssertions.body.added('contain description', (request) => {
      if (!request.value.description) {
        throw new RuleError({
          message: 'requests must contain a description',
        });
      }
    });
  },
});
```

requestAssertions.body also includes a number of common helper functions. These are invoked by defining a lifecycle trigger, and then the helper function. e.g. `requestAssertions.body[lifecycle].helperFunction()`.

The helper functions that are included are:

- matches
- matchesOneOf

All of these helper functions can be inverted by prefixing with `.not`.

i.e. `requestAssertions.body.added.not.matches({ schema: { type: 'array' } })`

### matches

`requestAssertions.body[lifecycle].matches(shape)`

Expects the operation to match a shape. The default behavior is to do a partial match.

```javascript
import { Matchers } from '@useoptic/rulesets-base';

new RequestRule({
  ...,
  rule: (requestAssertions) => {
    requestAssertions.body.added.matches({
      description: Matchers.string
    });
  },
});
```

### matchesOneOf

`requestAssertions.body[lifecycle].matches(shape)`

Expects the operation to match one of an array of shapes. The default behavior is to do a partial match.

```javascript
import { Matchers } from '@useoptic/rulesets-base';

new RequestRule({
  ...,
  rule: (requestAssertions) => {
    requestAssertions.body.added.matches([
      { description: Matchers.string },
      { summary: Matchers.string },
    ]);
  },
});
```

## requestAssertions.property

requestAssertions.property is used to define request body property rules.

`requestAssertions.property[lifecycle](assertion)`

```javascript
new RequestRule({
  ...,
  rule: (requestAssertions) => {
    // lifecycle rules that are available are added, changed, addedOrChanged, requirement and removed
    requestAssertions.property.added('contains a type', (property) => {
      if (!property.value.type) {
        throw new RuleError({
          message: 'properties must contain a type',
        });
      }
    });
  },
});
```
