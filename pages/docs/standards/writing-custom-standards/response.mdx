# Responses

A `ResponseRule` allows you to write assertions around the response status codes in your API Specification.

```javascript
new ResponseRule({
  name: "prevent response removal",
  rule: (responseAssertions) => {
    responseAssertions.removed("not remove response", () => {
      throw new RuleError({
        message: "cannot remove an response",
      });
    });
  },
});
```

`new ResponseRule(options)`

The following table describes the options object.

| property | description                                                                                                                                                                                               | required | type                                                                         |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name     | the name of the rule                                                                                                                                                                                      | yes      | `string`                                                                     |
| matches  | A function used to determine when this Rule should be applied. Return true to indicate this Rule should run.                                                                                              | no       | `(response: Response, ruleContext: RuleContext) => boolean`                  |
| docsLink | A link to the documentation for this ruleset. This will be used to show the user on a rule error. If there is a more specific docsLink (e.g. on a nested Rule), the more specific docsLink will be shown) | no       | `string`                                                                     |
| rule     | A function to define assertions for a specification.                                                                                                                                                      | yes      | `(responseAssertions: ResponseAssertions, ruleContext: RuleContext) => void` |

## matches

`matches` is invoked with a `Response` and `RuleContext`.

Example:

```javascript
new ResponseRule({
  ...,
  // only matches responses with content type 'application/json' and status code 201 in post operations
  matches: (response, ruleContext) => (
    ruleContext.operation.method === 'post' &&
    response.statusCode === '201'
  ),
  ...
});
```

## responseAssertions

responseAssertions is used to define response rules.

`responseAssertions[lifecycle](assertion)`

```javascript
new ResponseRule({
  ...,
  rule: (responseAssertions) => {
    // lifecycle rules that are available are added, changed, addedOrChanged, requirement and removed
    responseAssertions.added('contain description', (response) => {
      if (!response.value.description) {
        throw new RuleError({
          message: 'response must contain a description',
        });
      }
    });
  },
});
```

responseAssertions also includes a number of common helper functions. These are invoked by defining a lifecycle trigger, and then the helper function. e.g. `responseAssertions[lifecycle].helperFunction()`.

The helper functions that are included are:

- hasResponseHeaderMatching

All of these helper functions can be inverted by prefixing with `.not`.

e.g. `responseAssertions.added.not.hasResponseHeaderMatching('X-Application', { description: Matchers.string })`

### hasResponseHeaderMatching

`responseAssertions[lifecycle].hasResponseHeaderMatching(headerName, shape)`

Expects the operation to match a shape. The default behavior is to do a partial match.

```javascript
import { Matchers } from '@useoptic/rulesets-base';

new ResponseRule({
  ...,
  rule: (responseAssertions) => {
    responseAssertions.added.hasResponseHeaderMatching('X-Application', {
      description: Matchers.string
    });
  },
});
```

## responseAssertions.header

responseAssertions.header is used to define response header rules.

`responseAssertions.header[lifecycle](assertion)`

```javascript
new ResponseRule({
  ...,
  rule: (responseAssertions) => {
    // lifecycle rules that are available are added, changed, addedOrChanged, requirement and removed
    responseAssertions.header.added('contains a description', (header) => {
      if (!header.value.description) {
        throw new RuleError({
          message: 'header must contain a description',
        });
      }
    });
  },
});
```

# Response Body

A ResponseBodyRule allows you to write assertions about the shape of the response bodies:

```javascript
new ResponseBodyRule({
  name: "prevent response body removal",
  rule: (responseBodyAssertions) => {
    responseBodyAssertions.body.removed("not remove response", () => {
      throw new RuleError({
        message: "cannot remove an response",
      });
    });
  },
});
```

`new ResponseBodyRule(options)`

The following table describes the options object.

| property | description                                                                                                                                                                                               | required | type                                                                                 |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| name     | the name of the rule                                                                                                                                                                                      | yes      | `string`                                                                             |
| matches  | A function used to determine when this Rule should be applied. Return true to indicate this Rule should run.                                                                                              | no       | `(response: ResponseBody, ruleContext: RuleContext) => boolean`                      |
| docsLink | A link to the documentation for this ruleset. This will be used to show the user on a rule error. If there is a more specific docsLink (e.g. on a nested Rule), the more specific docsLink will be shown) | no       | `string`                                                                             |
| rule     | A function to define assertions for a specification.                                                                                                                                                      | yes      | `(responseBodyAssertions: ResponseBodyAssertions, ruleContext: RuleContext) => void` |

## matches

`matches` is invoked with a `ResponseBody` and `RuleContext`.

Example:

```javascript
new ResponseBodyRule({
  ...,
  // only matches responses with content type 'application/json' and status code 201 in post operations
  matches: (response, ruleContext) => (
    ruleContext.operation.method === 'post' &&
    response.contentType === 'application/json' &&
    response.statusCode === '201'
  ),
  ...
});
```

## responseBodyAssertions.body

responseBodyAssertions.body is used to define response rules.

`responseBodyAssertions.body[lifecycle](assertion)`

```javascript
new ResponseBodyRule({
  ...,
  rule: (responseBodyAssertions) => {
    // lifecycle rules that are available are added, changed, addedOrChanged, requirement and removed
    responseBodyAssertions.body.added('contain description', (response) => {
      if (!response.value.description) {
        throw new RuleError({
          message: 'response bodies must contain a description',
        });
      }
    });
  },
});
```

responseBodyAssertions.body also includes a number of common helper functions. These are invoked by defining a lifecycle trigger, and then the helper function. e.g. `responseBodyAssertions.body[lifecycle].helperFunction()`.

The helper functions that are included are:

- matches
- matchesOneOf

All of these helper functions can be inverted by prefixing with `.not`.

e.g. `responseBodyAssertions.body.added.not.matches({ schema: { type: 'array' } })`

### matches

`responseBodyAssertions.body[lifecycle].matches(shape)`

Expects the operation to match a shape. The default behavior is to do a partial match.

```javascript
import { Matchers } from '@useoptic/rulesets-base';

new ResponseBodyRule({
  ...,
  rule: (responseBodyAssertions) => {
    responseBodyAssertions.body.added.matches({
      description: Matchers.string
    });
  },
});
```

### matchesOneOf

`responseBodyAssertions.body[lifecycle].matches(shape)`

Expects the operation to match one of an array of shapes. The default behavior is to do a partial match.

```javascript
import { Matchers } from '@useoptic/rulesets-base';

new ResponseBodyRule({
  ...,
  rule: (responseBodyAssertions) => {
    responseBodyAssertions.body.added.matches([
      { description: Matchers.string },
      { summary: Matchers.string },
    ]);
  },
});
```

## responseBodyAssertions.property

responseBodyAssertions.property is used to define response body property rules. You can write a rule about all properties (including request body properties) using the [PropertyRule](/docs/rules/schema-property).

`responseBodyAssertions.property[lifecycle](assertion)`

```javascript
new ResponseBodyRule({
  ...,
  rule: (responseBodyAssertions) => {
    // lifecycle rules that are available are added, changed, addedOrChanged, requirement and removed
    responseBodyAssertions.property.added('contains a type', (property) => {
      if (!property.value.type) {
        throw new RuleError({
          message: 'properties must contain a type',
        });
      }
    });
  },
});
```
