#### Capturing test traffic

Optic can intercept traffic from your tests, provided they are sent over the network. When you run `capture` with `--command` flag the proxy will start and then run the command provided with `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` injected into the environment:

```bash
optic oas capture openapi.yaml <target-url> --command <your-test-command>
```

If your tests do not run over the network, many frameworks have HAR logging libraries you can use to capture a HAR and pass it into Optic directly `verify --har logs.har`.
