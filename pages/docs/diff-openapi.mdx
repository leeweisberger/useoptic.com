# Prevent breaking changes

Optic can [compute the changes](/docs/core-concepts#spec-to-spec) between any two OpenAPI versions. This makes it easy to catch breaking changes in development and CI, long before they make it to production and break a consumer.

The `diff` command integrates with Git to make comparisons easy:

```bash
optic diff openapi.yml --base main --check
```

- `--base` is the base branch you want to compare your recent changes to
- `--check` tells Optic to check the changes. You can learn how to configure breaking changes and other checks here

    **Note on history**:
    `optic diff` works off the objects in your local copy. If you are seeing different results running locally than in CI, make sure you've fetched the latest commits.

    **Note on new OpenAPI files**:
    If you add a new OpenAPI file (for instance for a new microservice), and it only exists in your HEAD branch, Optic will compare it to an empty OpenAPI file. Most of the time this has the expected behavior: everything in the spec will be marked as `added`.

    />
</div>


#### Visual Changelogs

Reading a line diff of a large OpenAPI file is difficult, especially when you use `$ref` throughout the spec. Optic will visualize the effective API changelog if you pass the `--web` flag making it easy to understand the scope of your changes:

```bash
optic diff openapi.yml --base main --check --web
```

### Two files use case

You can also call `optic diff` on two OpenAPI files without relying on Git history. It is most often used by teams who use a different OpenAPI file for each version of their API. The first argument is `from` and the second argument is `to`:

```bash
optic diff v1.yaml v2-beta.yaml
```

### Comparing arbitrary versions of your OpenAPI files

If you want to compare arbitrary versions of the files, you can use the `rev:name` format (from `git show`). This example compares the version of the spec on `d100855` to the spec on `6ec96c`:

```bash
optic diff d100855:openapi.yaml 6ec96c:openapi.yaml
```

<Callout>
    **Diff using tags:**
    If you want to diff by tag, use `git rev-parse [tag]` to look up the commit sha

    ```
    optic diff $(git --oneline rev-parse v2.0.0):openapi.yaml $(git --oneline rev-parse v3.0.0):openapi.yaml
    ```

</Callout>

### Compatibility

We take pride in how thorough Optic's OpenAPI support and diff engine are:

- Validates against the [OpenAPI 3.1 or 3.0 specification](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0).
- Supports `$ref` reference to a URL as long as they are be valid YAML/JSON, and resolvable from the machine running `optic`
- Circular references will not break the tool, but schemas including circular references will be truncated



## Next steps: Running Optic in CI
Most users run Optic in their CI pipelines to flag breaking changes. Check out our CI Recipes here
