# Share docs with your team

Optic makes it easy to share your OpenAPI documentation with other people on your team, and consumers across your organization.

Just login:

```bash
optic login
```

And add your OpenAPI specs:

```
optic api add service-a/openapi.yml
```

If you want to add all the OpenAPI specs in a repo, you can run:

```
optic api add --all
```

You'll notice one line was added to each file: `x-optic-url`. Optic uses this pointer to uniquely identify this OpenAPI in CI and on other developer's machines. Commit this change to your version control system.

Open the link in your terminal output to review your API's documentation in Optic Cloud.
