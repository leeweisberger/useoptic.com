1. **Fees**. You shall pay us the fees set forth in each Order (“**Fees**”), in accordance with the terms set forth therein and these Terms.  All amounts paid or payable are non-refundable, non-cancelable and non-creditable. Unless otherwise stated in an Order, you shall be responsible for and shall pay all Taxes imposed on or with respect to the Services that are the subject of these Terms. “**Taxes**” mean all applicable federal, state and local taxes, fees, charges, or other similar exactions, including, without limitation, sales and use taxes, excise taxes, VAT, GST, and other license or business and occupations taxes. For purposes of this Section 8(a), Taxes do not include any Taxes that are imposed on or measured by our net income, property tax, or payroll taxes.
1. **Payments**. WE DO NOT PROCESS PAYMENT FOR ANY SERVICES. To facilitate payment for the Services via bank account, credit card, or debit card, we use third-party payment processors (collectively, “**Payment Processors**”). These payment processing services are provided by the Payment Processors and are subject to the applicable Payment Processor’s terms and conditions, privacy policy, and all other relevant agreements (collectively, the “**Payment Processor Agreements**”).

You also authorize Company to share such information and other transaction information related to your payment for the Services with the Payment Processors. You will promptly update your account information with any changes (for example, a change in your billing address or credit card expiration date) that may occur. You hereby authorize the applicable Payment Processor to store and continue billing your specified payment method even after such payment method has expired, to avoid interruptions in payment for your use of the Services. Please contact the applicable Payment Processor for more information. Company assumes no liability or responsibility for any payments you make through the Services.

If you dispute any charges you must let Company know within thirty (30) days after the date that Company charges you. We reserve the right to change the Fees. If Company does change Fees, Company will provide notice of the change on the Site or in email to you, at Company’s option, at least thirty (30) days before the change is to take effect. Your continued use of the Services after the price change becomes effective constitutes your agreement to pay the changed amount. Company may choose to bill through an invoice, in which case, full payment for invoices issued in any given month must be received by Company thirty (30) days after the mailing date of the invoice, or the Services may be terminated. Unpaid invoices are subject to a finance charge of 1.5% per month on any outstanding balance, or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is lower, plus all expenses of collection.

You shall return or destroy all copies of all Optic Content and all portions thereof in your possession and certify such destruction to us, if such certification is requested by us.
2. **Confidentiality**. Any technical, financial, business or other information provided by one Party (the “**Disclosing Party**") to the other Party (the “**Receiving Party**") and designated as confidential or proprietary or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure (“**Confidential Information**") shall be held in confidence.  The Receiving Party will not use the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party except in exercising its rights or performing its obligations under these Terms.  The Receiving Party will not disclose the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to any third party; provided, that, the Receiving Party may disclose such Confidential Information to its employees and contractors who have a need to know and who have signed written agreements containing restrictions consistent with this Section 10. The Receiving Party shall use the same degree of care that it uses to protect the confidentiality of its own confidential information of like kind (but not less than reasonable care). These obligations shall not apply to information that (i) was previously known by the Receiving Party, as demonstrated by documents or files in existence at the time of disclosure; (ii) is generally and freely publicly available through no fault of the Receiving Party; (iii) the Receiving Party otherwise rightfully obtains from third parties without restriction; or (iv) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without reference to or reliance on the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information, as demonstrated by documents or files in existence at the time of disclosure. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to the extent compelled to do so by law, provided the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prior notice of the compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at the Disclosing Party’s cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the disclosure. If the Receiving Party is compelled by law to disclose the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information as part of a civil proceeding to which the Disclosing Party is a party, and the Disclosing Party is not contesting the disclosure, the Disclosing Party shall reimburse the Receiving Party for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing secure access to that Confidential Information. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, the Receiving Party shall furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information that is legally required and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment shall be accorded the Confidential Information
2. **Indemnification**. You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Company, its Affiliates, and its and their respective officers, employees, directors, service providers, licensors, and agents (collectively, the “**Company Parties**”) from any and all losses, damages, expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, rights, claims, actions of any kind, and injury (including death) arising out of or relating to your use of the Services, any of Your Data and User Content, your connection to the Services, your violation of these Terms, or your violation of any rights of another. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you will have no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless any Company Party from or against any liability, losses, damages, or expenses incurred as a result of any action or inaction of such Company Party. Company will provide notice to you of any such claim, suit, or proceeding. Company reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter which is subject to indemnification under this section, and you agree to cooperate with any reasonable requests assisting Company’s defense of such matter. You may not settle or compromise any claim against the Company Parties without Company’s written consent. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or releasing party.” If you are a resident of another jurisdiction, you waive any comparable statute or doctrine.
